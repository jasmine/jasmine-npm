# Jasmine 5.0.0 Release Notes

This release updates the jasmine-core dependency to 5.89.0. See the
[jasmine-core release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/5.9.0.md)
for more information.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed startup hang when using ES module loaders in parallel mode

## Changes to supported platforms

* Node versions before 18.20.5 are no longer supported

  Older 18.x versions might still work, but Jasmine is no longer tested in them
  prior to release.

## Documentation improvements

* Fixed jsdoc description of Configuration#requires

## Internal improvements

* Removed shelljs and rimraf dev dependencies

## Supported environments

This version has been tested on Node 18.20.5*, 20, 22, and 24.

\* Environments that are past end of life are supported on a best-effort basis.
They may be dropped in a future minor release of Jasmine if continued support
becomes impractical.
