# Jasmine 6.0.0-alpha.0 Release Notes

This is a pre-release, intended to offer a preview of breaking changes and to
solicit feedback. It updates jasmine-core to 6.0.0-alpha.0. Please see the
[jasmine-core release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/6.0.0-alpha.0.md)
for more information, including a list of breaking changes in that release.

## A Note About Pre-Release Compatibility

There may be additional breaking changes in future 6.0 pre-releases or in the
final 6.0 release. That's allowed by the semver specification, but users are
sometimes unpleasantly surprised by it.

NPM's implementation of carat version ranges assumes that subsequent
pre-releases and final releases are fully compatible with earlier pre-releases.
If your package.json contains `"jasmine": "^6.0.0-alpha.0`, NPM might install
any later 6.x version even though there is no guarantee of compatibility. If
that isn't ok, you should specify an exact pre-release version:
`"jasmine": "6.0.0-alpha.0"`.

## Changes to supported environments

* Node 18 is no longer supported.

## Breaking changes

* Only load one config file even if more than one is present.

# Internal improvements

* Dogfood the new default behavior of core `boot()`.

## Supported environments

This version has been tested on Node 20, 22, and 24.
